Less efficient:
Get the data from Firebase
Check for duplicates
Merge duplicates (add them together or delete them both and create a new entry with them added)
Save the cleaned up data
Display to the user

Better:
User enters data
Check if it already exists
Add them together/Merge/Delete (however you like)
Store on Firebase
